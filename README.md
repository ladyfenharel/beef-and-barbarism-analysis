# Beef and Barbarism: A Data-Driven Analysis of America's Meat Industry

This project explores the intersection of meat consumption, colonialism, and racial capitalism in the late 19th century United States. Using real historical data, I created visualizations and tables that quantify beef consumption patterns and Native American land loss alongside cattle industry expansion.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- Historical beef consumption by region and nation (1961)
- Indexed comparison of Native land loss and cattle expansion (1865â€“1890)
- Visuals created in Python using matplotlib
- Contextual analysis combining data and primary sources

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Microsoft Word (Report layout)
- Data sourcing from FAOSTAT, "Invasion of America," USDA Census
